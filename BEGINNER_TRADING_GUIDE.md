## Common Beginner Mistakes (Avoid These!)

### ❌ Mistake #1: No Seed Phrase Backup
**Problem:** Lose your wallet, lose your crypto forever
**Solution:** Write down seed phrase on paper NOW

### ❌ Mistake #2: High Slippage
**Problem:** Buy at worse prices
**Solution:** Set slippage to 2-10% based on volatility

### ❌ Mistake #3: Trading Too Much
**Problem:** Lose money on fees and bad trades
**Solution:** Start with small amounts ($10-50)

### ❌ Mistake #4: Sharing Wallet Address
**Problem:** Scammers can't steal with address alone, but don't share carelessly
**Solution:** Only share with trusted people

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Checking Fees
**Problem:** Surprised by costs
**Solution:** Bot always shows fees before trade - review them!

### ❌ Mistake #6: Buying Random Tokens
**Problem:** Rug pulls and scams
**Solution:** Research on Birdeye or DEX Screener first
